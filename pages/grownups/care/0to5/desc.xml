Babies should receive their first dental checkup by age 1! At this point the child can be assessed for Early Childhood Caries (cavities or baby bottle decay) and can also have their risk of dental disease evaluated. Infants should have their mouths wiped out with xylitol impregnated wipes to prevent bacteria growth. An infantâ€™s mouth and gums should also be wiped out with a wet cloth after feeding to clear away food particles.

Once teeth start erupting, they should be thoroughly cleaned on all five exposed surfaces to prevent Early Childhood Caries (cavities or baby bottle decay).
Baby sized tooth brushes are available and should be used on new teeth with a smear of toothpaste.
Tooth decay can start as early as 11 months, and by the time your infant is 1 year old, they may suffer from cavities.

Infants should not be continuously fed, especially at night, but should have regular meal times. Constant exposure to sugars in milk or juice gives bacteria ample fuel to grow and decay teeth. Having decayed baby teeth will cause new adult teeth to also be decayed! Tooth decay can cause children to avoid hard food and can disturb sleep. This means that children will not get the nutrition or rest required to be happy or grow.

Giving children constant sugar is like putting gasoline on a forest fire. Allow breaks for the mouth to recuperate between feedings. 

Children at this age are not old enough to brush and floss by themselves. They do not have the cognitive or motor abilities to thoroughly clean their teeth.
