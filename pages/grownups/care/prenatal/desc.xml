Dental disease in pregnant mothers
is closely correlated with dental disease in their infants.

Bacteria and infection can easily spread
from a mother to her child in the months after birth.

All primary caregivers should have full medical checkups
including dental checkups to identify and treat disease before birth.

To avoid passing bacteria to infants, caregivers should
clean their mouths using xylitol based anti-bacterial wipes.

To promote healthy tooth development,
pregnant mothers should insure that they
get enough Vitamin D in their diet.
