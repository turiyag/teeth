			<body>
Dental disease in pregnant mothers is closely correlated with dental disease in their infants. Bacteria and infection can easily spread from a mother to her child in the months after birth. All primary caregivers should have full medical checkups including dental checkups to identify and treat disease before birth. Caregivers should use xylitol based topical wipes to reduce bacterial cultures in their mouths to avoid passing the bacteria on to children.
