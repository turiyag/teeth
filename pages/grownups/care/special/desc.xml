Children with special needs tend to suffer from more dental disease.

Children with special needs require extra support in many aspects of their lives,
and dental health is certainly one of them.

Children with special needs may not have
the cognitive or motor abilities to properly clean their teeth,
and it can be a challenge to get them to clean their teeth.

Early intervention as infants can help build good oral health.
Clean infantsâ€™ mouths with a wet cloth,
and thoroughly clean every surface of newly erupted teeth.

As your child grows, you will need to support them with brushing and flossing.
Mouth wash may be an effective aid to ensure cleanliness of the entire mouth.

Dental disease such as Dental Caries can exacerbate other disorders.

Children with heart disease or blood disorders can have
severe complications from Dental Caries.
Children with diabetes or leukemia can develop
extreme infections from Dental Caries.

If your child suffers from a disease or disorder,
other diseases can compound the issue.

Keep your child healthy by
preventing the disease before it happens!
