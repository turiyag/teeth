At this age, children will start to lose their baby teeth to be replaced by new adult teeth. If the baby teeth suffered from decay, the new adult teeth will too! Children can start flossing and brushing by themselves and a pea-sized amount of toothpaste should be used. Regular dental checkups should occur to ensure healthy tooth development.			</body>

			<body>
The new adult teeth will be with children for the rest of their lives. In order to ensure a beautiful and healthy smile and oral health, dental care must start early. If children do not clean their teeth well, then as adults they will suffer poor oral health, and as a consequence the rest of their body may suffer too.
