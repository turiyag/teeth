			<body>
Cavities or Dental Caries is the most common oral disease, and it is entirely preventable! Bacteria that live in the mouth seek out food particles left behind after we eat. When they find food, they eat it and excrete it. These excretions cause our teeth to decay.

In order to prevent decay and to maintain a healthy mouth, brush and floss your teeth every day, after every meal if possible.
