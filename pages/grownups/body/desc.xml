The mouth is the gateway to the body.
The mouth is used to eat, breathe, and speak.
Everything that we consume passes through the mouth.

The body is a single complex machine where each part is 
connected to and interacts with every other part. 
Oral disease can affect all parts of the body, not just the mouth.

The mouth is the top and the entry point
for the digestive and the respiratory systems.
All of the nutrients and oxygen that
we need to survive come through the mouth. 

If the mouth is unhealthy, then our entire body is affected.
