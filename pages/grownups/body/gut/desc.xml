			<body>
By the time bacteria reaches the gut it has been mostly killed off, but that doesnâ€™t mean it doesn't cause damage. The body reacts to the dead bacteria in the gut like it's a microscopic invader known as an antigen. The body creates antibodies to attack the dead bacteria, causing symptoms of illness and distracting the body's defense from actual threats.			</body>
