The mouth is used to eat, breath, and speak.
If you've ever suffered from a tooth ache, you know that these basic functions cause pain. Every time you eat hard food, breath cold air, or press your tongue against a tooth, you cause your tooth pain to flare up.
Eating, breathing, and speaking are all activities that we do constantly, and for a developing child, affecting these integral activities has serious results.

 Children who suffer from dental decay suffer constant pain. They will avoid eating many foods, and will have their sleep interrupted by the pain. Without proper nutrition and rest, children’s development is severely impacted. Chronic pain causes changes in the <a href ="http://home.edgemontgeek.com/dev/teeth/grownups/body/brain/1">brain’s</a> development. When children experience constant pain or discomfort their brain learns to never feel comfortable, and is only ever under stress.
