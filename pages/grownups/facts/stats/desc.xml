Chronic dental infection is the most common progressive chronic problem in children under age 6. It is 5 times more common than asthma! In Alberta, 28% of 2-5 year olds suffer from cavities. An estimated 23% of children do not receive any treatment and are left to suffer. Thatâ€™s 1.2 million children in USA and Canada who are left in constant pain.
