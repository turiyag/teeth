Chronic dental infection is the most common progressive chronic problem in children under age 6. It is 5 times more common than asthma! In Alberta, 28% of 2-5 year olds suffer from cavities. An estimated 23% of children do not receive any treatment and are left to suffer. That’s 1.2 million children in USA and Canada who are left in constant pain.

Dental surgery accounts for the majority of children’s hospital surgeries. In Alberta 13 thousand children have dental surgery per year! The cost for operation rooms in hospitals runs to $6.25 million per year for dental surgeries, and this number does not include dental care or other professional fees!  That’s over $6.25 million of fully preventable surgery!
