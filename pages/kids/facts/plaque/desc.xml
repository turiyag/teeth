Plaque is a film that forms on teeth that arenâ€™t kept clean. The plaque is made of bits of food and <a href="http://home.edgemontgeek.com/dev/teeth/kids/facts/bacteria/">bacteria</a>. Plaque is soft and easy to brush off, but if you leave it, then the tooth underneath the film will disolve.

Plaque also causes your teeth to change colours. Plaque can make your teeth
yellow, orange, or brown.
