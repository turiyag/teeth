			<body>
Toothaches are caused by cavities. Cavities are areas of your teeth that have rotted away because of the <a href="http://home.edgemontgeek.com/dev/teeth/kids/facts/bacteria/">bacteria</a> that live in our mouths.

When cavities are bad, they make a hole to the middle of the tooth, which is soft and has blood vessels and nerves that connect with the rest of your body.
It is very painful to have cavities!
You may have troubles eating, speaking,
and even breathing.
