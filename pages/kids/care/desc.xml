It's easy to brush and floss your teeth.

While brushing your teeth, listen to a song. When the song is over, you should have brushed all of your teeth well.

Listen to another song, and by the time that one is finished, you should be done flossing!

			<body>
Measure dental floss to be about as long as your forearm.
Wind the floss around your middle fingers.
Gently rock the floss between your teeth.
Run the floss up and down both teeth in the gap.
Gently rock the floss out.
Repeat the rocking with a clean part of your floss for every gap between your teeth.
